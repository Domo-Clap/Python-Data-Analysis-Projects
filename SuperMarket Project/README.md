I worked on this project recently after working through a majority of a Udemy class on the topic of python data analytics.
I found this project prompt and dataset online. Then I just performed some basic analytics on it using Seaborn, Numpy, and Pandas.
It isn't the best of work, but it helped me remember some things I learned in a college class I had and from the class I completed recently through Udemy.
I still need to get some more experience with Seaborn, but I was able to get a better understanding of the different kinds of graph types there are available.
